             This keystroke experiment is being produced as part of the coursework for
             Computer Science course CS229 at Stanford University. Participants in experimental evaluation
             of this analysis provide their keystroke identity used to analyze in further individual classification.
             Data will be collected by the timestamp and characters/symbols that participant responds on their keyboard.

            Participant anonymity will be provided by the separate storage of names from data.
            Data will only be identified by participant number.
            No identifying information about the participants will be available to anyone except the researcher.
