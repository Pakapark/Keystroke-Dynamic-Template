# Keystroke Tracker Template

This template is designed to gather the keystroke data for each participant in offline manner. This keystroke data can be used to train the program to identify the keystroke's owner using simple machine algorithm (like XGBoost Tree). The original purpose of this template is to help Stock Sawasdee gathering keystroke data for CS229 Machine Learning class at Stanford University.
